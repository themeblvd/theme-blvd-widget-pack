When using a Theme Blvd theme, this plugin adds six widgets to extend some of the functionality already built into the framework.

== Description ==

After activating this plugin, six new widgets will be added under *Appearance > Widgets* of your WordPress admin panel.

= Mini Post Grid =

This widget utilizes the theme framework's post grid system to display a grid of featured images from posts. Standard framework featured image link settings will be utilized here and the posts used for the grid can queried in different ways. You can also choose to substitute in gallery of images belong to a page or post.

= Mini Post List =

This widget utilizes the theme framework's post list system to display a simple list of post titles and their associated featured images. Standard framework featured image link settings will be utilized here and the posts used for the list can queried in different ways.

= Simple Contact =

This widget provides you with some standard contact information you can fill out. Additionally you can setup a 1-6 icons linking to your relevant social networks; the 30 standard social network icons are included as possible selections for each.

= Twitter =

Nothing unique here. This widget will allow you to utilize the framework's internal system for pulling a list of tweets from your desired Twitter account. Tweets are cached and updated every two hours.

= Video =

This widget will allow you to display any video compatible with WordPress's [oEmbed system](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds). When using this widget, you can take advantage of the fact that any video inserted via oEmbed with a Theme Blvd theme is responsive; this will allow your sidebar's video to scale down gracefully with the rest of your website.

= Horizontal Menu =

This widget allows you to select from any menus you've created under *Appearance > Menus* and display it horizontally in the design format setup by the framework's inclusion of Twitter Bootstrap. Utilize this widget within the theme's various collapsible, horizontal widget areas.

**NOTE: For this plugin to do anything, you must have a theme with Theme Blvd framework v2.2+ activated.**
